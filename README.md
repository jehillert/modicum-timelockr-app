# Modicum Timelockr

### WHAT DOES THIS APP DO
This is a mobile app built with React Native to control a Noke Smart Lock. The app uses redux, redux saga, and an Android native module to access the [Nokē Mobile Library for Android](https://github.com/noke-inc/noke-mobile-library-android) and control the lock. Unlock codes are retrieved from Noke's ACaaS backend using the [Nokē Core API](https://github.com/noke-inc/noke-core-api-documentation). The app is a work in progress and the intended use cases for the lock have not yet been implemented.
